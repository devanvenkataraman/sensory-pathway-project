# CYOA
A Choose Your Own Adventure I made using React.js. It features a save function (with WebStorage) and an inventory.


This mini-project was started in codepen.io and I decided to give Github a go, so I will continue it from here. You can check the older versions here:
1. https://codepen.io/LeWanderer/pen/aRRbVg
2. https://codepen.io/LeWanderer/pen/PyxpLB
3. https://codepen.io/LeWanderer/pen/zmMpdY
4. https://codepen.io/LeWanderer/pen/zmydXx
4. (4.5 - Latest version on Codepen) https://codepen.io/LeWanderer/pen/NOZoXp

**Note**: As I'm working on a computer without Node, I couldn't properly set up Babel so I had to merge my "app.js" and "index.html".
